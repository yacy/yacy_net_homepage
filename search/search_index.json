Consequently, this uses a lot of disk space. We make the resources which YaCy takes configurable with the following service. YaCy loves to use more RAM if available, give it more RAM and it performes better! Network Activity YaCy makes a lot of network connections and it is transparent about doing that.

YaCy is a distributed Web Search Engine, based on a peer-to-peer network. What does indexing mean? Indexing means that a web page is separated into the single words on it and to save the URLs to the sites containing them under a reference to the word itself in a database. So searching for a word (or many words) may be easily performed by fetching all URLs \"belonging\" to the search term. What is a DHT? A distributed hash table (DHT) is a class of a decentralized distributed system that provides a lookup service similar to a hash table; (key, value) pairs are stored in a DHT, and any participating node can efficiently retrieve the value associated with a given key. Responsibility for maintaining the mapping from keys to values is distributed among the nodes, in such a way that a change in the set of participants causes a minimal amount of disruption.(source:Wikipedia) What's the meaning of \"to crawl\"? A so-called \"crawler\" fetches a web page and parses out all links on it; this is the first step or \"depth 0\". It continues to get all web pages linked on the first document which is then called \"depth 1\" and does the same respectively for all documents of this step. The crawler is limitable to a specified depth or can even crawl indefinitely and so can crawl the whole \"indexable Web\", including those parts of the indexable web who are censored by commercial search-engines and therefore normally not part of what most people are presented as The visible web. What is a P2P network? Meaning Peer to Peer computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or work loads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes. Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth, directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or stable hosts. Wikipedia What is a Peer? A peer is a communications endpoint in a computer network. Each peer offers its services and uses the services of other peers. In YaCy, a peer provides web indexing services to other peers on the YaCy search network. What is RWI? RWI is an acronym for Reverse Word Index. This is generated by the indexer from the collected data and stored in the database. Isn't P2P illegal? No. P2P (peer to peer) only describes the technology by which computers exchange data amongst themselves. Past legal disputes have been over what types of data have been exchanged over such networks. Namely, copyrighted material. The P2P file sharing technique itself is legal, despite the fact that it has been used facilitate in the transfer of copyrighted data. The only files shared amongst YaCy peers are indexes of the publicly accessible internet. YaCy in general What are global and local indexes? Once you use the proxy, a local copy of the indexed data is automatically created. You can access the global index only if the program has a connection to the YaCy network. This is effectively the combination of all local indexes. I am not a technican. Can I install YaCy easily and use it to index my own web pages? YaCy is very easy to install. You don't need any special knowledge or additional software; also you don't need to set up an extra database engine. Indexing your own website isn't hard too: Simply crawl it and turn off DHT Distribution and DHT Receive to keep the index of your site on your peer. Can I crawl and index the web with YaCy? Yes. You can start your own crawl and you may also trigger distributed crawling, which means that your own YaCy peer asks other peers to perform specific crawl tasks. You can specify many parameters that focus your crawl to a limited set of web pages. Is there a central server? Does the search engine network need one? No. The YaCy network architecture does not need a central server, and there is none. There are currently four so-called seed-list servers hard-coded into source code due to they are mostly available and have accurate seed list information (see FAQ for details). Search Engines need a lot of terabytes of space, don't they? How much space do I need on my machine? The global index is shared, but not copied to the peers. If you run YaCy, you need an average of the same disc memory amount for the index as you need for the cache. In fact, the global space for the index may reach the space of Terabytes, but not all of that is on your machine! Do I need a fast machine? Search Engines need big server farms, don't they? You don't need a fast machine to run YaCy. You also don't need a lot of space. You can configure the amount of Megabytes that you want to spend for the cache and (currently only indirectly) the index. Any time-critical task is delayed automatically and takes place when you are idle surfing (this works only if you use YaCy as http proxy). How long does a search take? Time for a search depends on many factors. One is, if you perform a local-only search or a global DHT-based search. Another factor comes in place when enable search heuristics. A third and important factor is if you have already searched for it often (short time between two same searches), in this case the search may still be cached. Another factor is if the parameter verify=true, if so the fetched HTML snippet got verified, say fetched again. If you use verify=false this may give you less accurate search results (wrong maybe) but they are way faster. In general YaCy's architecture does not do peer-hopping, it also doesn't have a TTL (time-to-live). It is expected that search results are instantly responded to the requester. This can be done by asking the index-owning peer directly which is in fact possible by using DHT's (distributed hash tables). Because YaCy needs some redundancy to compensate for missing peers, it asks several peers simultaneously. To collect their response, YaCy waits a little time of at most 6 seconds (by default, you can change that). Do I need to set up and run a separate database? No. YaCy contains its own database engine, which does not need any extra set-up or configuration. What does Virgin, Junior, Senior, Principal Status mean? virgin Status Virgin means your peer did not have contact to the network yet. Simply put, you are \"offline\". You can search the local index only. junior Status Junior means your peer has contact to the yacy network but cannot be reached by other peers. One reason could be a firewall or missing router configuration. You can search the local index only. Junior peers can contribute to the network by submitting index files to senior/principal peers without being asked. senior Status Senior means your peer has contact to the yacy network and can be reached by other peers. It is now an access point for index sharing and distribution. You can search the local and global index. This is the best status to use, it supports the network. principal A Principal is a Senior peer that uploaded an additional peer-list to a server. This list supports other peers to get in contact with the existing Yacy network to perform a global search. If you have the possibility to upload a file to an FTP server, you can become a Principal by uploading your peer-list. Why should I run my peer in Senior Mode? Some p2p-based file sharing software assign non-contributing peers very low priority. We think that that this is not always fair since sometimes the operator does not have the choice of opening the firewall or configuring the router accordingly. Our idea of 'information wares' and their exchange can also be applied to junior peers: they must contribute to the global index by submitting their index actively, while senior peers contribute passively. Therefore we don't need to give junior peers low priority: they contribute equally, so they may participate equally. But enough senior peers are needed to make this architecture functional. Since any peer contributes almost equally, either actively or passively, it is not mandatory. However, since any peer can add to the index, but what is added can only be stored on and found through senior peers, you should decide to run in Senior Mode if you can. Even if only 1/10 of the peers which were Junior as of March 2012 become Senior, the network\u2019s capacity will grow considerably. My peer says it runs in 'Junior Mode'. How can I run it in Senior Mode? Open your firewall for port 8090 (or the port you configured) or program your router to forward this port to your computer. Will running YaCy jeopardize my privacy? YaCy respects user privacy. All password- or cookies-protected pages are excluded from indexing. Additionally, pages loaded using GET or POST parameters are not indexed by default. Thus, only publicly accessible, non-password-protected pages will be indexed. For a detailed explanation on the technique: How YaCy protects your privacy wrt to personalized pages. Can other people find-out about my browsing log/history? There's no way to browse the pages that are stored on a peer. A search of the pages is only possible on a precise word. The words are themselves dispatched over the peers thanks to the distributed hash tables (DHT). Then the hash tables of the peers are mixed, which makes retrieving the history of browsing of a certain peer impossible. My YaCy search pages doesn't show! The default address for the YaCy search and administration page is http://localhost:8090. If you are using Internet Explorer, please mind adding http:// before localhost:8090. In case you have changed the default port of YaCy from 8090 to another one, you will have to open the new port in your firewall or router (and maybe close the port 8090 if you don't use it). Another reason could be a bad setting of the proxy, in which case you need to deactivate the proxy for the local pages. Why does YaCy show different results from Google? We expect YaCy to show different results than Google, for several reasons. As long as YaCy has only a few peers working, it cannot compete with Google. Hence the importance of having a great number of YaCy peers working. But even then YaCy will provide different and better results than Google, since it can be adapted to the user's own preferences and is not influenced by commercial aspects. I can not uninstall, because YaCy is still running First check whether YaCy still runs. If it doesn't run, it may not have been shut down properly. Start YaCy again, then uninstall. Alternatively delete the yacy.running file in the yacy/DATA/ directory, then uninstall. How can I help? First of all: run YaCy in senior mode. This helps to enrich the global index and to make YaCy more attractive. If you want to add your own code, you are welcome; but please contact the author first and discuss your idea to see how it may fit into the overall architecture. You can help a lot by simply giving us feedback or telling us about new ideas. You can also help by telling other people about this software. And if you find a bug or you see an uncovered use-case, we welcome your bug-report. Any feed-back is welcome. Technology Something seems not to be working properly ; what should I do? YaCy is still undergoing development, so one should opt for a stable version for use. The latest stable version can be downloaded from the YaCy homepage http://www.yacy.net. If you are experiencing a strange behaviour of YaCy then you should search the Wiki or the forum http://www.yacy-forum.org/ for known issues. If the issue is unknown, then you can ask for help on the forum (and provide the YaCy version, details on the occurrence of the issue, and if possible an excerpt from the log file in order to help fix the bug). How can I index Tor or Freenet pages? The indexing of Tor or Freenet pages is for the moment deliberately avoided in the source code because it is not desired to index these pages at this stage of the development of YaCy. However, the crawling of such sites is planned in the future. Most likely the crawl results will not distributed globally, but will only be available to the local peer. How do I give the index of one peer to another? This actually happens automatically through the DHT distribution of the words. However, there is also the possibility of transferring the entire index to another peer. This can either be done through a so-called Index-Transfer (link needs update) or a index-Import (link needs update). Will already-indexed pages (i.e. indexed and index-exchanged) automatically be reindexed after a few days/years? Unfortunately no. However, there is the possibility for a chronological \"recrawl\" to be executed for a URL (or an entire website if desired). Learn more about this feature under \"Index Control\" -> \"Index Creation.\" Are DHT entries unique in a search network or can URLs also appear twice or three times? URLs are analyzed more than once so that a peer delayed does not lose his part in the search index. As for the indexes they are stored redundantly on multiple peers. How can I change the Connection Timeout value? This can be done on the configuration page \"Admin Console\" -> \"Advanced behavior\" http://localhost:8090/ConfigProperties_p.html. Just search for the line client-timeout and change the value there. The timeout is in milliseconds. Do not forget to restart YaCy after the change. Alternatively, another way to do this is through the configuration file httpProxy.conf in DATA/SETTINGS. If this type of configuration is to be performed then YaCy must be stopped before. I can not log in YaCy anymore as I forgot my password. How do I reset my password? If you have lost your password, you can reset it (or choose a new one). There are two methods: Password reset while YaCy is running This is the most convenient way. You don't need to shut down YaCy: Use a command line terminal and log in to the user account running YaCy then execute <yacy-app>/bin/passwd.sh <new-password> This changes only the admin account password for the account named 'admin'. Password reset while YaCy is shut down: edit the file DATA/SETTINGS/yacy.conf: remove the entry serverAccountBase64MD5 remove the entry adminAccount (if any) choose a new password by setting the entry serverAccount to \\<account>:\\<password>, for example serverAccount=admin:mysecretpassword The next time you start YaCy the account/password combination will be read, encrypted and then deleted from yacy.conf, so that it will not be available in plain text anywhere anymore. Then you will be able to log again into YaCy with the account/password you entered in the yacy.conf file, or set another password if you didn't set a combination. Disk space How can I limit the size of single files to be downloaded? The maximum file size can be set under Advanced settings -> Crawler settings. Maximum sizes can be specified for HTTP and FTP. The file size is in bytes. A converter can be found at Bit and Byte (bits and bytes) (broken link) How many links/words and how much disk space can a YaCy instance manage? The number of storable links/words is theoretically not limited, but it becomes actually limited following the slowdown of the indexing process with the increase of the links/words number. There are users with more than 10 million Web pages indexed in their YaCy instance. Also, the necessary space for the index of a web page depends on the size and nature of the document. With 10 million web pages indexed, an index size of 20GB is not uncommon. Can I limit the size of the indexes on my hard-drive? For the moment not directly. Automatically limiting that size would mean having to delete stored indexes, which is not suitable. You can set two minimums of free disk space at /Performance_p.html: one for the crawls, and the other for DHT-in. The number for crawls seems to have to be equal or bigger than the number for DHT-in. Note that, with DHT-in disabled, global searching using the peer's UI is disabled. Also proxy/crawling privacy might suffer. You can also just disable \u201cIndex Receive\u201d at /ConfigNetwork_p.html, so that your index is only augmented through crawling (over which you have some control). For a very indirect additional limit, you can change the Index Reference Size at /IndexControlRWIs_p.html.","title":"FAQ"},{"location":"faq/#faq-frequently-asked-questions","text":"Improve this doc","title":"FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions"},{"location":"faq/#general","text":"","title":"General"},{"location":"faq/#what-is-this","text":"YaCy is a distributed Web Search Engine, based on a peer-to-peer network.","title":"What is this?"},{"location":"faq/#what-does-indexing-mean","text":"Indexing means that a web page is separated into the single words on it and to save the URLs to the sites containing them under a reference to the word itself in a database.

The /Crawler_p.html can be called directly to show monitoring information but it is also the API access point to start a crawl using a direct call to the url as shown below: http://localhost:8090/Crawler_p.html?crawlingDomMaxPages=10000&range=wide&intention=&sitemapURL=&crawlingQ=on&crawlingMode=url&crawlingURL=http://vip.asus.com/forum/default.aspx%3FSLanguage%3Den-us&crawlingFile=&mustnotmatch=&crawlingFile%24file=&crawlingstart=Neuen%20Crawl%20starten&mustmatch=.*&createBookmark=on&bookmarkFolder=/crawlStart&xsstopw=on&indexMedia=on&crawlingIfOlderUnit=hour&cachePolicy=iffresh&indexText=on&crawlingIfOlderCheck=on&bookmarkTitle=&crawlingDomFilterDepth=1&crawlingDomFilterCheck=on&crawlingIfOlderNumber=1&crawlingDepth=4 The parameters used here are explained below in detail. Each YaCy crawl job has its own profile to store information to ensure proper handling of crawled URLs. It is created at crawl start, will be set as terminated if a crawl is considered to be finished, and may also be edited or deleted while the crawl is running. To start a new crawl and create its profile following parameters are needed crawlingstart = (no value needed) - this key must be present to trigger a crawl start crawlingMode = Possible values: 'url', 'sitemap', 'sitelist', 'file'. The crawler can be started with different modes: 'url': start from a given url which is the root of a crawl tree. The url is given in 'crawlingURL'. If this url is a http-link, then the Crawl will subsequently load all linked documents from http until a given depth is reached. If this url is a smb- or ftp-link, then the given resource will be listed completely using a special listing process. 'sitemap': use a sitemap to retrieve all files that are listed in the sitemap. The sitemap-URL is given in 'sitemapURL' 'sitelist': use a list of crawl start URLs. This is like starting with one url, but using several of them. The list of urls is retrieved by loading the url given in 'crawlingURL'. Each of the urls in that file is then used to start it's individual crawl. This makes sense if the 'range' attribute contains the value 'domain' or 'subpath' which creates an individual must-match pattern for each of the urls in the sitelist. 'file': use a file in the local file system to provide a start document. The crawl will then start like with a root url but the file itself will not be placed to the index, only the documents which are linked in that document. crawlingURL = The crawl start url. This value must be present in all cases of the crawlingMode options. The crawler's double-check does not check this start url which means that in the index existing start-URLs are always loaded (but can be loaded from the cache, see the cachePolicy option for that. sitemapURL = Only to be defined if 'crawlingMode' = 'sitemap'. This is an url which is typically linked within a robots.txt file. The sitemapURL must point to a resource which is formed as described in http://www.sitemaps.org crawlingFile = Only to be defined if 'crawlingMode' = 'file'. This is a path to a file in the local file system. The content of the file is parsed and all urls inside that document are roots for crawl starts as defined in this crawl request. crawlingDepth = This defines how often the Crawler will follow links embedded in websites. A minimum of 0 is recommended and means that the page set as crawling URL, sitemap orfile will be added to the index, but no linked content is indexed. 2-4 is good for normal indexing. Be careful with the depth, consider a branching factor of average 20; A crawleing depth of 8 would index 25.600.000.000 pages, maybe this is the whole WWW. crawlingDepthExtension = This is a regular expression that can be used to extend the crawling depth to infinity. That means, if this pattern matches with the URL, the crawling depth is not a limitation any more on the ongoing crawl. Default is an empty String, which is a never-match regular expression. range = Possible values are 'domain', 'subpath' or not set, which means 'wide'. Default is 'wide'. If this value is set to 'domain' or 'subpath', the 'mustmatch' parameter is set automatically and overrides given values in that field. 'domain' creates a 'mustmatch' value which restricts the crawl to pages on the same domain of the start-url; 'subpath' creates a 'mustmatch' value which restricts the crawl to pages within the same subpath of the start-url. mustmatch = The filter is a regular expression that must match with the URLs which are used to be crawled; default is 'catch all'. Example: to allow only urls that contain the word 'science', the filter is set to '. science. '. An automatic domain-restriction can be used to fully crawl a single domain. mustnotmatch = This filter must not match with the URL to allow that the page is accepted for crawling. The empty string is a never-match filter which should do well for most cases. ipMustmatch = The filter is a regular expression that must match with the IP of the host to be crawled; default is 'catch all'. ipMustnotmatch = This filter must not match with the IP of the host to allow that the page is accepted for crawling. The empty string is a never-match filter which should do well for most cases. indexmustmatch = This filter can be used to filter documents to be indexed. Even if a document was loaded by the crawler because the mustmatch filter allows that, this filter can be used to restrict documents to be indexed. Default is catch-all. indexmustnotmatch = This filter must not match to allow that the page is accepted for indexong. Default is an empty string, which is a never-match to exclude no documents from indexing. deleteold = if 'range' is either 'domain' or 'subpath' or the mustmatch-value is not catchall, this option can be used to delete all urls for given start-hosts. Possible values for 'deleteold' are 'off' (do not delete), 'on' (delete all documents for the start host(s), or 'age'. If 'age' is used, the values 'deleteIfOlderNumber' and 'deleteIfOlderUnit' must be set and this defines the limit for the deletion: if the load date of a stored document is older than the given time, then it is deleted. deleteIfOlderNumber = If 'deleteold' is 'age', then this must be set with a numeric value. The unit is given in field 'deleteIfOlderUnit'. deleteIfOlderUnit = Possible values are 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour' recrawl = value is either 'nodoubles' or 'reload'. This value is a switch which activates the usage of 'reloadIfOlderNumber', and 'reloadIfOlderUnit' values. If 'nodoubles' is selected then every url that the crawler discovers and is already stored in the index is rejected and not loaded again. If 'reload' is selected then 'reloadIfOlderNumber' and 'reloadIfOlderUnit' is a limit for the double-check: if the load date of a new page url is older than the given time, then it is considered as stale and reloaded for indexing. If it is newer then it is considered as fresh and therefore as 'double' in the double-chech. reloadIfOlderNumber = If 'recrawl' is 'reload', then this must be set with a numeric value. The unit is given in field 'crawlingIfOlderUnit'. reloadIfOlderUnit = Possible values are 'year', 'month', 'day', 'hour' crawlingDomMaxCheck = The maxmimum number of pages that are fetched and indexed from a single domain can be limited with this option. If combined with the 'Auto-Dom-Filter' the limit is applied to all the domains within the given depth. Domains outside the given depth are then sorted-out anyway. crawlingDomMaxPages = Integer values are allowed. If this value is given, then the maximum number of pages per domain is restricted to this given number. crawlingQ = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. A questionmark is usually a hint for a dynamic page. URLs pointing to dynamic content should usually not be crawled. However, there are sometimes web pages with static content that is accessed with URLs containing question marks. directDocByURL = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. If this is 'on', then all documents which are linked from loaded pages are indexed with their URL only and without any metadata. This applies also if these documents are outside of the crawl depth or do not match with regular expressions. storeHTCache = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. If 'on', all downloaded content is stored in a built-in cache, the HTCache. cachePolicy = The caching policy states when to read from the HTCache during crawling: no cache: never use the cache, all content from fresh internet source; if fresh: use the cache if the cache exists and is fresh using the proxy-fresh rules; if exist: use the cache if the cache exist. Do no check freshness. Othervise use online source; cache only: never go online, use all content from cache. If no cache exist, treat content as unavailable indexText = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. If this is 'on' then the fulltext is indexed. If 'off', only the metadata of the pages or media according to 'indexMedia' is recorded and indexed. indexMedia = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. If this is 'on' then the metadta (if available) of media content. If 'off', only the metadata of the pages or fulltext according to 'indexText' is recorded and indexed. crawlOrder = value is either 'on' or 'off'; default is 'off'. If 'on' the crawler will contact other peers and use them as remote indexers for your crawl. If crwling results are needed locally, this switch should be set to false. Only senior and principal peers can initiate or receive remote crawls. A YaCyNews message will be created to inform all peers about a global crawl, so they can omit starting a crawl with the same start point. intention = This is a text message that is posted along with the crawlOrder option to inform other YaCy peers about a distributed crawl. If 'crawlOrder' is 'off', this value is not used. xsstopw = This can be useful to circumvent that extremely common words are added to the database, i.e. \"the\", \"he\", \"she\", \"it\"... To exclude all words given in the file yacy.stopwords from indexing, this hast to be set true. collection = The name of a collection or a comma-separated list of collections. This collections can be used to separate search results into different subsets which is used with the GSA search interface using the 'site' parameter in the search request. agentName = The name of a user agent that is used for crawling. Possible values are: 'YaCy Internet (cautious)', 'YaCy Intranet (greedy)', 'Googlebot', 'Random Browser' or 'Custom Agent'. If 'Custom Agent' is used, then the user agent credentials can be set in yacy.conf with the attributes 'crawler.userAgent.name' (i.e. 'yacybot'), 'crawler.userAgent.string' (i.e. 'yacybot ($$SYSTEM$$) http://yacy.net/bot.html'), 'crawler.userAgent.minimumdelta' (i.e. '500') and 'crawler.userAgent.clienttimeout' (i.e. '10000'). The 'crawler.userAgent.name' is the token which is selected in robots.txt files for robots rules.

You can easily discover large packages with dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Installed-Size} ${Package} [depends: ${Depends}]\\n' | sort -n which lists each package with occupied kilobytes, the package name and the dependencies for that package. A good starting point is the removal of large packages with many dependencies because chances are high that then again orphaned packages appear which can be removed with the 'Orphaned Package Removal' from last section. Remove Software with Large Runtime Some software on your server may consume a lot of CPU time. If some of these processes are of no use for you, you can delete them. To discover such processes, run top -bn1 | grep root | sort -k11 Whenever you removed more packages, run the 'Orphaned Package Removal' process again. Remove Old Kernel Modules Kernel modules take up a large disk space and can easily be removed. To ensure that you are doing the right thing, first check which kernel you are running with uname -r Then you can look for the modules which are stored with ls /lib/modules Finally remove the modules, which are not identical to the one as discovered with uname -r using i.e. apt-get remove --purge 3.5.0-17-generic and so on for all old kernel. This will free about 100MB of disk space for each kernel. Search for installed packages Whenever you want to remove a package, you must know the name of that package. The package names of all installed packages can be listed with dpkg --get-selections This can be useful i.e. if you want to see if you have two versions of the same tool, i.e. dpkg --get-selections *jre* may show you that you have installed jre-6 and jre-7, so you can remove one of them. You can also remove all linux source headers files, search for headers which will free a large amount of space. Prepare for tiny VirtualBox ova Appliance Dumps To further shrink the debian installation (i.e. to prepare an appliance dump in VirtualBox), it makes sense to remove more never-used applications and data. Reduce Data http://wiki.debian.org/ReduceDebian has some hints to reduce debian, this is what removes most of the remaining data: rm -Rf /usr/share/locale rm -Rf /usr/share/doc rm -Rf /usr/share/man As a very last step you can also delete the package lists rm -r /var/lib/apt/lists .. which will free about 100MB of disk space. The lists directory is recreated the next time you run apt-get update. Wipe Out Empty Space When you export a virtual machine to a ova Appliance dump, the virtual disk is compressed. To enhance this process, it is necessary to zero all empty disk space. The easiest way to do this is: dd if=/dev/zero of=/emptyspace rm -rf /emptyspace Shrink Virtual Disk Image VirtualBox has some command-line tools, this is what you would like to do to reduce the disk size after you wiped out the empty space: VBoxManage modifyhd --compact my_disk_image.vdi In case that you created the virtual machine from a ova dump, you probably don't have a vdi file but a vmdk file. This cannot be shrinked with VBoxManage, but you can create a vdi file out from the vmdk which can be shrinked then: VBoxManage clonehd --format vdi my_disk_image.vmdk my_disk_image.vdi When doing this, you must assign the new disk to the virtual machine in the VirtualBox GUI. However, a shrinked vmdk file is mostly smaller than a shrinked vdi file, therefore it does not make sense to apply this on an already shrinked appliance.","title":"Shrink Debian by removing all graphical features to turn it into a headless server"},{"location":"operation/shrink/#shrink-debian-by-removing-all-graphical-features-to-turn-it-into-a-headless-server","text":"For YaCy, no online graphical interface is needed.
